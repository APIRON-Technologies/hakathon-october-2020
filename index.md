### Internal Hackathon: October 2020

Welcome to our internal hackathon!

### Fiew words about hackathon

Usually an internal hackathon is when business emlpoyees, internal stakeholders and internal partners come together to solve specific challenges that are at the hearty of the organization.

This is not our case!

On our first hackathon, our main objective is to **enjoy the day**! 
Feel free to collaborate with each other and let your creativity guide you.
Pick a topic, brainstorm with the team, set-up tasks, distribute the tasks, create, deliver!

### The rules

Our first internal hackathon is a **24h** event. Starting on **Friday October 2nd at 20:00** and ending on **Saturday October 3rd at 20:00** Greek time, you have 24 hours to think, schedule, organize your team and deliver the product.

During those 24h you can leave, get some rest, come back whenever you want. You can also continue at home if you don't want to visit the offices (although we will have pizza).

The participation is optional (obviously). You can come only for the pizza! But *only* the team members who participate have the right to claim the price.

Use whatever language you choose. There is no technology stack limitation.

### Deliverable
