### Internal Hackathon: October 2020

Welcome to our internal hackathon!

### Few words about hackathon

Usually an internal hackathon is when business employees, internal stakeholders and internal partners come together to solve specific challenges that are at the hearty of the organization.

This is not our case!

On our first hackathon, our main objective is to **enjoy the day**! 
Feel free to collaborate with each other and let your creativity guide you.
Pick a topic, brainstorm with the team, set-up tasks, distribute the tasks, create, deliver!

### The rules

Our first internal hackathon is a **24h** event. Starting on **Friday, October 2nd at 20:00** and ending on **Saturday, October 3rd at 20:00** Greek time, you have 24 hours to think, schedule, organize your team, and deliver the product.

During those 24h you can leave, get some rest, come back whenever you want. You can also continue at home if you don't want to visit the offices (although we will have pizza).

The participation is optional (obviously). You can come only for pizza! But *only* the team members who participate have the right to claim the price.

Use whatever language you choose. There is no technology stack limitation.

### Deliverable

Use the respective repository of your team. Update the `README.md` file and write the team members as well as the topic of your choice.

### The prize

The winner (team) will win:

* The pleasure of having a good time with your colleagues
* The experience of managing a whole project
* The experience of teamwork under a strict deadline
* One day off on **Friday, October 9th**.

### The evaluation process

The deliverable must:

* Exist
* Build / Compile / Run
* Fulfill the minimum criteria defined per topic
* Has as few bugs as possible
* In case of crash, must have at least a workaround

### Topics

You may choose one of the following topics and stick to it! 

1. **The Game**<br/>
Create a game. Using whatever tools you want. Make sure you can do it within 24h. The minimum requirements are: *A menu*, *Sound Effects*, *Music*, *At least an 8-bit color palette*, *Must run on a web browser*. If you manage to make it **multiplayer** it is a bonus.
2. **Mini CRM**<br/>
The idea is to make an **HR management tool**. It can be easily extended to a **general CRM** tool. The minimum requirements are: *Must be a web app*, *Users*, *Roles*, *Communication (forum-like or chat)*, *groups of users*. Good to have: *leave request - approval*, *user hierarchy*, *Generic entities related to users (documents, certificates, bonuses, ...)*.
3. **Logging System**<br/>
A tool that reads logs from a specific source (i.e. mongodb). Something like graylog (but a lot simpler). Minimum requirements are: *To have multiple levels of logs: error, debug, warning, ...*
4. **Face Recognition**<br/>
A lightweight tool that will be able to be deployed on a raspberry pi and with a camera can greet known people or ask the name of the unknown while taking photos in order to retrain.
5. **Code Evaluation Platform**<br/>
A tool similar to Hackerrank or Codility. Minimum requirements: *Admin panel where we can add the problem description, and a list with inputs and expected outputs*, *Result report with the percentage of successful cases*, *Logged in user to submit the solution*. Tip: Use docker.


## Enjoy!!!
